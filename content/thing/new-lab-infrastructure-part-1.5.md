This is part one-point-five of my effort to configure new lab infrastructure. It
was written mainly for my own reference during the process and later, when I
inevitably need to figure out WTF I did. This part preceeds my attempt to get
FreeNAS authenticating against the DC, because it turns out having trusted certs
is a prerequisite for that. It's best when your infrastructure trusts itself.

## Securing Things

To get trusted certificates, we have to do some magic with certbot and
letsencrypt to issue certs for the various services. Luckily, there's just one
place to set up certificates for Samba.

To pull this off, we're going to leave our internal infrastructure. LetsEncrypt
verifies that we are who we say we are during certificate renewal through a
variety of ACME challenge methods. The most popular is an HTTP-based chellenge,
but that doesn't work very well when you don't have a HTTP server. In this case,
we're going to use the DNS-based challenge, which drops a `TXT` record in DNS.
Public DNS for `funkhouse.rs` is already handled by Google Cloud DNS. As luck
would have it, `certbot` includes a [Google Cloud DNS
plugin](https://certbot-dns-google.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to automate most
of the work here.

### Set up Google Cloud DNS

In order for that tool to work, I need a service account on GCP that can modify
my DNS records. First, I need to create a role which has the permissions listed
on the plugin page, above. I accomplished this by cloning the _DNS
Administrator_ role and removing the things I didn't want it to do.

![Creating a DNS Twiddler role in Google Cloud DNS](gcp-dns-twiddler-role.png)

Now, I create a Service account which can fulfill this role for our DC, and
assign it to the role.

![Creating the Service Account](gcp-user-create-1.png)

![Assigning the Twiddler role to the new account](gcp-user-create-2.png)

Finally, I created a key for this service account and downloaded the JSON file.
This file I placed at
`/var/lib/letsencrypt/pharoah-cert-renewer-credentials.json`, owned by `root`,
with permissions `400`.

### Let's Encrypt!

First, install `certbot` and the Google DNS plugin using: `sudo apt install
certbot python3-certbot-dns-google`.

Then, try it out:

```console
christian@pharoah:~$ sudo certbot certonly --dns-google --dns-google-credentials /var/lib/letsencrypt/pharoah-cert-renewer-credentials.json -d pharoah.funkhouse.rs

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/pharoah.funkhouse.rs/fullchain.pem
   Your key file has been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/pharoah.funkhouse.rs/privkey.pem
   Your cert will expire on 2020-02-29. To obtain a new or tweaked
   version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot
   again. To non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run
   "certbot renew"
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
   making regular backups of this folder is ideal.

Not too shabby!

### Configuring Samba

Now that we have certificates, let's toss them at Samba. First, we need to copy
the crypto material into the Samba TLS directory to avoid mucking with the perms
under `/etc/letsencrypt`.

```console
christian@pharoah:~$ sudo rm /var/lib/samba/private/tls/*.pem
OK 01 Dec 2019 11:03:46 EST
christian@pharoah:~$ sudo cp -L \
>  /etc/letsencrypt/live/pharoah.funkhouse.rs/{cert,chain,privkey}.pem \
>  /var/lib/samba/private/tls/
OK 01 Dec 2019 11:04:01 EST
christian@pharoah:~$ ls -l /var/lib/samba/private/tls/
total 20
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1923 Dec  1 11:04 cert.pem
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1647 Dec  1 11:04 chain.pem
-rw------- 1 root root 1704 Dec  1 11:04 privkey.pem
OK 01 Dec 2019 11:04:12 EST
```

Crack open `/etc/samab/smb.conf` and add the following section:

```text
tls enabled  = yes
tls keyfile  = tls/privkey.pem
tls certfile = tls/cert.pem
tls cafile   = tls/chain.pem
```

Then restart Samba, and see how it likes those values.

```console
christian@pharoah:~$ sudo systemctl restart samba-ad-dc
OK 01 Dec 2019 13:43:09 EST
christian@pharoah:~$ sudo systemctl status samba-ad-dc

```

Well, that's promising. Now let's get a look at that certificate. Samba serves
LDAPS on port 636, so we'll point `openssl` at it.

```console
christian@pharoah:~$ echo -n | openssl s_client -connect 10.42.16.2:636 | sed -ne '/-END CERTIFICATE-/,/DONE/p'

Awwww yeah. Looks like it worked. Now that we're sure Samba will serve traffic
using the Let's Encrypt certificates, let's try to get it working with the
symlinks to the certificate files so we can use automatic renewal.

First, delete the certificates in their current location with `sudo rm /var/lib/samba/private/tls/*pem`

Then, make the TLS section of `/etc/samba/smb.conf` look like this:

```text
tls enabled  = true
tls keyfile  = /etc/letsencrypt/live/pharoah.funkhouse.rs/privkey.pem
tls certfile = /etc/letsencrypt/live/pharoah.funkhouse.rs/cert.pem
tls cafile   = /etc/letsencrypt/live/pharoah.funkhouse.rs/chain.pem
```

```console
christian@pharoah:tls$ sudo systemctl restart samba-ad-dc
OK 01 Dec 2019 13:58:38 EST
christian@pharoah:tls$ sudo systemctl status samba-ad-dc
‚óè samba-ad-dc.service - Samba AD Daemon
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/samba-ad-dc.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)

OK 01 Dec 2019 13:58:40 EST
christian@pharoah:tls$ echo -n | openssl s_client -connect 10.42.16.2:636 | sed -ne '/-END CERTIFICATE-/,/DONE/p'
... trimmed ...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
subject=CN = pharoah.funkhouse.rs

issuer=C = US, O = Let's Encrypt, CN = Let's Encrypt Authority X3

---
... trimmed ...
OK 01 Dec 2019 13:58:45 EST
```

Awesome. The symlinks work. This means that now we can just install a SystemD
timer that renews our Samba certificates, and give it a post hook to restart
Samba for us. Certbot comes with a renewal SystemD service and timer. Looking in
on the timer:

```console
christian@pharoah:system$ sudo systemctl list-timers certbot.timer
NEXT                         LEFT     LAST                         PASSED       UNIT          ACTIVATES
Mon 2019-12-02 01:34:42 EST  11h left Sun 2019-12-01 12:34:39 EST  1h 48min ago certbot.timer certbot.service

1 timers listed.
Pass --all to see loaded but inactive timers, too.
OK 01 Dec 2019 14:23:06 EST
```

Looks fine, but we need to make sure Samba is restarted when the certificate is
renewed. To do this, I've modified `certbot.service` to look like this:

```text
[Unit]
Description=Certbot
Documentation=file:///usr/share/doc/python-certbot-doc/html/index.html
Documentation=https://letsencrypt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/certbot -q renew --post-hook "systemctl restart samba-ad-dc"
PrivateTmp=true
```

And that ought to do it.
