I've been iterating on this rib rub for some time now. It's at the point where
I always enjoy it, and so does my family. Maybe yours will, too.

I've included the Sauce and Mops I use, below. They're made with the rub.

## Rub

- 1 tbsp Salt
- 2 tbsp Dark Brown Sugar
- 1 tbsp Cumin
- 2 tbsp Chili Powder
- 1 tbsp Black Pepper
- 1 tbsp Garlic Powder
- 1 tbsp Onion Powder
- 2 tbsp Paprika
- 2 tsp Ground Cloves

## Sauce Base*

- 1 ½ cups Ketchup (we use Heinz; my wife is very serious about this.)
- ½ cup Honey
- ½ cup Apple Cider Vinegar
- 2 tbsp Dark Brown Sugar
- 4 tbsp [Rub](#rub)

Heat it to simmering. The longer you let it simmer, the more the flavor mixes.
I usually give it 15minutes, and then let it cool on the stove.

*To finish the sauce for serving, I will mix the drippings from the ribs (after
the foil-wrapped stage of 3-2-1 cooking) into the sauce base. It means the
sauce doesn't keep more than a day or two, but it's _delicious._

## Mop

- ¼ cup Apple Juice
- ¼ cup Apple Cider Vinegar
- ½ cup Water
- 2 tbsp [Rub](#rub)

Mix it up and put it into a squeezable bottle.
